# flashlight-firebase

This is a working version of a remote control flashlight using Google Firebase. This allows remote control of your Android device flashlight throught a native app and a web client. My demo is available here: 'https://flashlight-193812.firebaseapp.com', but unusable unless I turn on the remote control access on the app installed on my device, so download and build yours to test.

Further details will be provided soon.
